# MapSwipe Web App

Welcome to [MapSwipe4Web](https://web.mapswipe.org). This web application complements the existing [mobile app](https://github.com/mapswipe/mapswipe) and allows users to contribute to [MapSwipe](https://mapswipe.org) from their browser.

## Developing, Building, and Contributing to MapSwipe

If you'd like to modify and improve the MapSwipe web app, read through the following to get familiar with the project. Please also read [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Technology Used

The app is written in [Vue](https://vuejs.org). It uses the same backend as the mobile app:
1. Firebase provides the backend database. It is protected with security rules so that users and contributors to this open source project can not cause damage.
1. The [workers](https://github.com/mapswipe/python-mapswipe-workers) on the backend are running on Google Cloud and handle pre-processing and post-processing the data.

## Project Setup

```sh
yarn
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
yarn lint
```

### Format with [prettier](https://prettier.io)

```sh
yarn format
```

### Pre-commit hook

Automate linting and formatting as pre-commit hook (from repo root):

```sh
ln -fs ../../pre-commit-hook .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
```

### Deployment

On any push to the main branch of this repository, the most recent **tagged** version **and** the latest version are built and deployed to [web.mapswipe.org](https://web.mapswipe.org) and [web.mapswipe.org/dev](https://web.mapswipe.org/dev) respectively (see [deployment workflow](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)).

## Acknowledgement

The web app was initially developed by [HeiGIT](https://www.heigit.org) with the support of the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/). It is based on an application developed for the [UndercoverEisAgenten](www.undercovereisagenten) project. UndercoverEisAgenten is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of the Citizen Science funding area. It is one of 15 projects that will advance the cooperation between citizens and scientists in terms of content and methodology as well as provide answers to societyâ€™s challenges until the end of 2024.
