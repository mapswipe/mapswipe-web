# Contributing

We want to invite the vast community of developers to contribute to our mission and improve MapSwipe web app.

## Contributions

We welcome any contributions that help improve the application. Before you start hacking, please read through [README](README.md) and the issues on GitHub to find the best fit for your skills. If you find a task that you are confortable working on, simply fork the repo and submit a PR (to the `main` branch) when you are ready!

If you are thinking of a change that is not trivial, we suggest you first [open an issue](https://github.com/mapswipe/mapswipe-web/issues) to discuss your proposed changes. This may save you a lot of time, as other people may be working on similar (or conflicting) changes.
